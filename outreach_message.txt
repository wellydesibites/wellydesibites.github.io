Subject: Collaboration Opportunity: [Your Business Name] & [Their Website Name]

Dear [Contact Person Name],

My name is [Your Name] from [Your Business Name], a Wellington-based bakery specializing in [mention your specialties, e.g., custom cakes, eggless desserts]. We've been following your website, [Their Website Name], for some time and admire your content on [mention specific topics they cover].

We believe our businesses share a similar audience interested in high-quality desserts and local Wellington businesses. We were wondering if you'd be open to a collaboration, such as:

* Featuring our bakery in a roundup of Wellington's best dessert spots.
* A guest post exchange, where we create content for your site and you create content for ours.
* A simple backlink exchange, where we link to your website from our site and you link back to us.

We're confident that a collaboration would be mutually beneficial, driving traffic to both of our websites and introducing our businesses to a wider audience.

Would you be open to discussing this further?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Business Name]
[Your Website URL]
