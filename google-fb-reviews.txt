									It was mouth watering and bursting with flavours. Very light Cake soaked in sweet Rose flavoured milk and topped with fresh whipped cream. The flavour is so balanced with adequate sweetness.
									It's different and perfect desi touch for Diwali party or any other party if you fancy some indian desi flavour order this and you will not be regret.”</p>
