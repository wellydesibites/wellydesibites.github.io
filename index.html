                                They not only work to make their cakes different to what you will otherwise get, but really work hard TO BRING A SMILE to their customers by making the moment really unique.
                                First double digit birthday's are special for everyone. Talking to the owner, I soon realized that she is a pro in her game. While she was not familiar with the OnePiece anime, she did a quick research and presented options for how the cake can be decorated.
                                You should have seen when my son saw the cake on his birthday. He was overjoyed and his eyes were left wide open with amusement!
                                Everyone appreciated the balanced sweetness, the black forest flavor and the fluffy texture of the cake!”</p>

                            <p>“I was the first customer for cake as I fully trust Shruti and the taste of her cakes. I ordered two cakes together 1 for my birthday and 1 for my 2 year old birthday celebration on a same day..🎂🎂 Shruti did amazing work and ensured us that cake will be ready on time as it was last minute order.🥰 1 cake was Rasmalai cake and another one was cocomelon theme chocolate cake. I can still feel the yumminess in my mouth.Literally drooling.🤤 Our guests was amazed and nothing was left😒 Everyone gobbled whole stuff and Nothing left to eat later😬😬 The softness and creaminess ..oh lord I hope anyone who tried shruti's cake can understand what I am talking about and who didn't come on order one and you can thank me later🤗 Looking forward to order many more.”</p>

                            <p>“I ordered a cake for my son's birthday party, and it was absolutely amazing! The design was exactly as we wanted, and the taste was even better—moist, flavorful, and not too sweet. Everyone at the party loved it! Shruthi did a fantastic job, as always not only in just making the cake but also giving honest advice how much we need and what extras we need . Kids loved the chocolate muffins which she said i should add. So , THANK YOU. Highly recommend! ”</p>
