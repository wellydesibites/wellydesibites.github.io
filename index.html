                                    I ordered two cakes together 1 for my birthday and 1 for my 2 year old birthday celebration on a same day..🎂🎂
                                    Shruti did amazing work and ensured us that cake will be ready on time as it was last minute order.🥰
                                    1 cake was Rasmalai cake and another one was cocomelon theme chocolate cake.
                                    I can still feel the yumminess in my mouth.Literally drooling.🤤 
                                    Our guests was amazed and nothing was left😒 Everyone gobbled whole stuff and Nothing left to eat later😬😬 
                                    The softness and creaminess ..oh lord I hope anyone who tried shruti's cake can understand what I am talking about and who didn't come on order one and you can thank me later🤗

                                    We don't really get these amazing varities for eggless cake, so would really try next one.
                                    Thanks Welly Desi Bites for this delicious & mouthwatering cake - a perfect fit for any celebrations & occasion.”</p>
